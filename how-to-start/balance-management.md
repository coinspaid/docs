EUR equivalent for each cryptocurrency on your balance is depicted below the amount of crypto itself.

The “Balances” tab is very important for managing your account, here you can see your depositing address for each active cryptocurrency. To see available actions, you need to select the currency; then a side window will open with all possible actions.

If you plan to receive a payment from another person, you can copy the link to the payment terminal and share it. When you click on this link, the user will see the following screen. This way, the payee won’t make a mistake in entering the address or the currency they’re sending.\

Click "Receive" to see the deposit address. In the window, you will see a form with the address; pay close attention to its name. Usually, the default address or the address that you used last time is displayed. In the drop-down list, you can see all the addresses that were created in the “My addresses” tab in the Addresses section.\
You can either copy the address or use the provided QR in case you find it more preferable. While depositing to the address make sure that the currency is correct and the amount is higher than our [minimal limits](../confirmations-and-limits.md).

By pressing the “Send” button you can access the menu that allows you to withdraw cryptocurrency. You need to specify the address and set the amount. Same rule applies to the withdrawal as well, you need to make sure that receiver’s address is correct, the currency is matching and the amount is above [the processing limits](../confirmations-and-limits.md).\

On this menu you can choose the currency you want to exchange and the currency that you want to obtain (either crypto or fiat) and set the amount. The exchange rate is fixed for one minute, if you exchange the funds within this time frame you get the exact amount of the target currency from the menu, if the timer has ran out new ratio will be calculated and fixed for another minute.
