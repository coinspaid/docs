A wide range of filtering options for transactions is available, which can be useful if you need to filter the transactions by a given parameter: currency, time, status, etc. Also, you can export the list of transactions into a `.csv` file by clicking the **Export** button in the upper right corner of the **Filter** menu.

You can get more information on a transaction by clicking it. The information will appear in the panel on the right side.

### Risk scoring

In cryptocurrencies, it is often possible to analyze whether the funds used in the new transaction have participated in any suspicious transactions in the past.

CoinsPaid makes such an analysis for BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, and USDT, providing two parameters for incoming transactions: **Risky inflow** and **Risk score**.

* **Risky inflow** is the amount of funds (in USD equivalent) that have originated from transactions that can be considered suspicious.
* **Risk score** is the percentage of suspicious inputs or addresses among their total number.

The parameters are available in the **Transactions** and **Invoices** tabs.

It is recommended to manually inspect the transactions with a risk score of about 75% or higher.

## Payments tab

The **Payments** tab also allows you to keep track of all transactions within your merchant account, and in addition, contains information on our processing fees applied to these transactions and the remainder of your funds after each transaction.
