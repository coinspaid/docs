# Discount system

CryptoProcessing application provides an opportunity to cut up to 20% of your costs for paying processing fees. In order to participate in a discount program, it’s required to keep CPD tokens on a merchant's balance. The discount that will be applied to the merchant’s operations is based on an Operations Volume over the last 30 days \(further: the 30D Volume\) and CPD Balance amount of this merchant.  


**Available Discount Levels:**  


| **30D Volume, USDT** | **Balance, CPD** | **Discount for Staking** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **&lt;50K** | **0** | **0%** |
| **&gt;50K** | **50,000** | **5%** |
| **&gt;500K** | **150,000** | **6%** |
| **&gt;1,500K** | **250,000** | **8%** |
| **&gt;2,500K** | **500,000** | **10%** |
| **&gt;5,000K** | **1,000,000** | **12%** |
| **&gt;10,000K** | **2,500,000** | **14%** |
| **&gt;20,000K** | **5,000,000** | **16%** |
| **&gt;35,000K** | **10,000,000** | **18%** |

**Get Your Discount**

The maximum discount that the merchant can get is determined by the 30D Volume of the merchant. 

For example, a merchant with the 30D Volume equal to 11,507,340.9562078 USDT is able to get the 14% discount maximum if this merchant holds 2,500,000 and more CPD tokens on the balance. \(please, refer to the table above in order to learn about the discount levels\)

The 30D Volume can be seen on the Fees tab in the Discount block in the merchant’s back office.

The merchant can top up their CPD Balance at the appropriate CPD amount to get a relevant discount \(up to the maximum available according to the current 30D Volume\).

For example, having the 30D Volume equal to 11,507,340.9562078, the merchant transfers 500,000 CPD to the balance to get a 10% discount.

**30D Volume Calculation**

The 30D Volume is calculated at 00:00 UTC at the beginning of each operational day and is fixed for the next 24 hours. 

It is calculated for the last 30 days as an aggregated amount of transactions with the processing fee being charged, including the MIN. AMOUNT FEE, however, only in case a fee percentage is specified in a respective package.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the 30D Volume is calculated in a specific way, as described above, so this value is not recommended to be used for the financial statistics. The 30D Volume is used exclusively to determine the discount.
{% endhint %}

**Discount Applying**

The discount is applied to the processing fee percentage in the operations with crypto currency.

The discount program is not applied to:

* Mining fee;
* Non-crypto operations;
* Min. amount fee.

A processing fee shall be paid based on the operation amount, debiting the current merchant’s discount. 

Example: a 1% fee set for the “BTC to fiat exchange” operations in the merchant’s fee package.

Having the 14% discount, the merchant will pay 0.86% processing fee instead of 1%.
