# FAQ

### **What is CoinsPaid?**

CoinsPaid is a business service and software product created to solve topical problems connected with payments, cryptocurrency exchange and storage for both businesses and individuals. CoinsPaid products include cryptocurrency processing \(accepting payments in cryptocurrency\) and a personal wallet\*

### Is CoinsPaid a regulated service provider?

Dream Finance OÜ, our company that provides CoinsPaid services, is licensed to provide cryptocurrency exchange and wallet services by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Estonia. As a licensed institution, we are obliged to identify our customers, and verify their identity using reliable sources \(the process known as “Know-Your-Customer”\) and maintain robust risk management procedures. This gives our clients peace of mind that their funds will not be commingled with illicit proceeds of bad actors.

### **How can I test your service?**

We can provide you with a trial account at CoinsPaid, where you can familiarise yourself with the merchant dashboard and test all the tools, but some pre-test steps are required from you:

1\) Download a testnet Bitcoin wallet.

2\) Get testnet\* coins by visiting a designated website and entering your address, generated in the testnet Bitcoin wallet.

3\) Wait for 1 confirmation to be able to spend test coins.

\*Please note that Testnet Bitcoins are never supposed to have any value. More information about Bitcoin testnet is available[ here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet).

### **How do I get a merchant account with CoinsPaid?**

Please apply by filling in the contact form on[ coinspaid.com](http://coinspaid.com/) or send an email to get@coinspaid.com. Our sales managers will contact you as soon as possible.

### **Does CoinsPaid provide a personal account?**

We are developing a personal account for users of our wallet; it is now in the testing phase and we’ll announce it as soon as it’s ready.

### **How much does CoinsPaid charge for its processing service?**

Integration is free. We only charge transaction fees. Transaction types are: deposit, withdrawal and exchange, we also have transaction combinations, such as deposits with instant exchange. The fees depend on the required options and the merchant’s business model. Please apply at get@coinspaid.com for an individual commercial offer.

### **What alternative payments do you support?**

At the moment we accept more than 50 altcoins \(BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, ETC, XRP, NEO, ADA, DOGE, USDT\) and ERC20 tokens. Also, we have direct bank wire for deposits and withdrawals in EUR.

We are working on adding more currencies and alternative payment methods like credit cards, SWIFT and popular e-money services.

### **How can I convert all these different coins to BTC?**

CoinsPaid provides the opportunity for both merchants and their end-users to send and receive over 140 cryptocurrencies inside their account in CoinsPaid, crediting the counter-party’s balance in the required coin. This option is available in manual mode for end-users and with the help of API for business.

### **Can I convert coins to EUR?**

Yes. CoinsPaid has a built-in instant exchange function. It allows CoinsPaid merchants to exchange the cryptocurrency paid by the customer into the fiat currency chosen by the seller immediately.

### **How often can I expect settlements?**

We make settlements by your request, we don't use rolling reserves so 100% of the funds are available for withdrawal anytime. Also, we have an auto withdrawal option for cryptocurrency: the system makes settlements automatically when the account balance reaches a certain threshold.

### **Do you have any partner programs?**

We do. We are ready to discuss individual terms based on your resources. Also, you can check the common terms on our site: [https://coinspaid.com/payment-gateway-affiliate-program/](https://coinspaid.com/payment-gateway-affiliate-program/)

### **Is it safe to keep our money in your wallet?**

Absolutely. Customer funds are stored in an offline cold wallet, which is protected from cyber attacks.

Operational, or “hot” wallet, holds funds required for automated operations, such as multiple payments to your clients. This wallet holds the CoinsPaid operational funds. So we have you covered.

Prior to integration, the operator decides how much money he wants to keep in our system, thereby setting storage limits. All funds exceeding these limits \(bankroll\) will be automatically transferred to the operator's external address.
