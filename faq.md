CoinsPaid provides the opportunity for both merchants and their end-users to send and receive over 140 cryptocurrencies inside their account in CoinsPaid, crediting the counter-party’s balance in the required coin. This option is available in manual mode for end-users and with the help of API for business.

### **Can I convert coins to EUR?**

Yes. CoinsPaid has a built-in instant exchange function. It allows CoinsPaid merchants to exchange the cryptocurrency paid by the customer into the fiat currency chosen by the seller immediately.

### **How often can I expect settlements?**

We make settlements by your request, we don't use rolling reserves so 100% of the funds are available for withdrawal anytime. Also, we have an auto withdrawal option for cryptocurrency: the system makes settlements automatically when the account balance reaches a certain threshold.

### **Do you have any partner programs?**

We do. We are ready to discuss individual terms based on your resources. Also, you can check the common terms on our site: [https://coinspaid.com/payment-gateway-affiliate-program/](https://coinspaid.com/payment-gateway-affiliate-program/)

### **Is it safe to keep our money in your wallet?**

Absolutely. Customer funds are stored in an offline cold wallet, which is protected from cyber attacks.

Operational, or “hot” wallet, holds funds required for automated operations, such as multiple payments to your clients. This wallet holds the CoinsPaid operational funds. So we have you covered.

Prior to integration, the operator decides how much money he wants to keep in our system, thereby setting storage limits. All funds exceeding these limits (bankroll) will be automatically transferred to the operator's external address.
