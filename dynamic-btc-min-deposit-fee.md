# Dynamic BTC min deposit fee

As the mining fees for BTC are always changing, we have adopted a dynamic BTC minimum deposit fee approach instead of a “one size fits all” model. In this model we cover all mining fees for BTC ourselves and the merchant is only subjected to a minimum deposit fee.

The minimum deposit fee applicable to BTC will depend on the average transaction fee of the previous week. The table below can be used as a guide for the price brackets and the minimum deposit fee that will be applicable. 

| <p><strong>Avg transaction</strong><br><strong>fee in USD</strong><br><strong>for the previous</strong><br><strong>week</strong></p> |        | <p><strong>Min deposit</strong><br><strong>fee applicable </strong><br><strong>in EUR</strong></p> |

Should the average fee remain in the same bracket, the min fee applicable will remain the same. In the eventuality of a shift in the average transaction fee bracket we will inform our merchants via email and telegram. The minimum deposit fee change shall always be applied on Wednesdays at 10:00 UTC following the notifications sent on Mondays. \
